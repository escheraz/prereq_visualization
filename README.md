# prereq_visualization
Visualization of Prerequisites/Corequisites for MIT courses

The graph files were generated with the python script.

Each graph file consists of all classes in one major, plus their immediate prerequisites in other majors. 

The .cys file is openable with Cytoscape and contains all the graphs. 

The prereq_visualization directory allows for the graphs to be visualized with Javascript. It is a direct export from Cytoscape, with a slight modification to styles.js.
